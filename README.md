# VeriboxCodeAssesssment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.5.

### Install dependencies

Install the dependencies running:

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Discrepancies between the code and the Code assessment:

Accorrding with the Code assessment, there are: *tarif name*, *tarif benefits* and apparently a link to the tarif. In the *data.json* file those values doesn't exist; So I use Similar values in order to fulfill the requirements as similar as possible to the Code assessment.

### Features Completed until 3 hours (Verivox time limit)

- [x] Develop an Angular result list with the appended mock data. 
- [x] Create an async service, which returns the mocked data (fake API). 
- [] The layout should be responsive or fluid (whatever preference you have)  
- [] Use a mobile first approach (the created scribbles are a general guideline for how it's supposed to look like) 
- [x] Please also implement three filters to sort the tariff list (download/upload speed, price or any of the tariff attributes)
